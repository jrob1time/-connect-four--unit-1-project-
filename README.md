# Connect Four!

With a personal spin being inspired by one GA Bootcamps MORNING ATTENDANCE QUESTIONs: Pancakes or waffles? Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The player tokens were chosen with this breakfast theme in mind. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. The overall design was done with a high contrast color template to incorporate minimal accessibility features allowing for this theme of the traditional connect four to evolve over time as well as a playful syrup and butter background to round out the styling of the game. Enjoy!
